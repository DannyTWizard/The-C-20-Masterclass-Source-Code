    . Exceptions and objects: 
        .#1: Throwing class objects
            . see exceptions_1.ixx

        .#2: Throwing class objects with inheritance and polymorphism
            . see exceptions_2.ixx


    . Build instructions: 
        . Bare hands with CMake: 
            . cmake -S . -B build
            . cmake --build build

        . With CMake presets (VS Code): 
            . Select configure preset
            . Select build preset
            . Use the run and debug buttons: We can debug application right from the start.

        . Can also use presets on the command line.
    . Dependencies: 
        . gcc 14 or up (can be official container)
        . cmake 3.29 or up
        . ninja 1.11 or up
        . vcpkg and setting up the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable
        . gdb any version

    . Philosophy: 
        . All non module looking code should be hidden away in the utilities module.
