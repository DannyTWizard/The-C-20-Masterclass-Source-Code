    . More on initialization: 
        . #1: Aggregate initialization
        . #2: Designated initializers
        . This chapter needs more updates on initialization and aggregates. Will do when creating slides.
    . Build instructions: 
        . Bare hands with CMake: 
            . cmake -S . -B build
            . cmake --build build

        . With CMake presets (VS Code): 
            . Select configure preset
            . Select build preset
            . Use the run and debug buttons: We can debug application right from the start.

        . Can also use presets on the command line.
    . Dependencies: 
        . gcc 14 or up (can be official container)
        . cmake 3.29 or up
        . ninja 1.11 or up
        . vcpkg and setting up the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable
        . gdb any version

    . Philosophy: 
        . All non module looking code should be hidden away in the utilities module.
