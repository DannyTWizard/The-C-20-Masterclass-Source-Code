    . Facts about polymorphism
        . Polymorphism relies on virtual functions.
        . A virtual function is a function in the base class that can be overridden 
                in derived classes.
        . Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism by ensuring that the correct 
            function (based on the actual object type) is called, WHEN accessed 
            through a base class pointer or reference.
        . When a derived class provides its own implementation of a virtual function 
            from the base class, this is called function overriding.
        . Overriding allows derived classes to provide specific behavior while keeping 
            the same interface (method signature) as the base class.
        . The override keyword is used to indicate that a function is intended to 
            override a virtual function in the base class. It's optional,  
            but highly recommended.
        . Polymorphism at runtime occurs when the decision of which method to invoke 
            (from base or derived) is made during program execution, based on the 
            actual object type.
        . This enables flexibility, where the exact type of object doesnâ€™t need to be 
            known at compile time, but the correct function is still invoked.

        . When a base class has virtual functions, it must also have a virtual 
            destructor to ensure proper cleanup of derived objects when deleted 
            through a base class pointer.
        . Prevents memory leaks or undefined behavior during destruction. For now, 
            always make the destructor virtual when you have virtual functions. We'll
            see an example of this in the next lecture.
        . The compiler uses a virtual table (vtable) to keep track of virtual 
            function addresses. Each object of a class with virtual functions 
            contains a pointer (called vptr) to the vtable of that class.
        . The vtable allows dynamic dispatch of functions at runtime, enabling polymorphism.
        . Implementation Detail: This process is automatic and managed by the compiler.
