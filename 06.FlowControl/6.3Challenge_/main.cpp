/*
    . GUI Challenge: SFML
        . Change the application to store data in predefined variables.

    . NOTE: 
        . This example won't work in containers because they don't have a xserver
            set up. It's possible to set up one but we'll pass for this course.
        . You can run it: 
            . On a local box with the requirements met: 
                . a compiler with support for modules with cmake:   
                    . gcc 14 and up
                    . clang 16 and up
                    . latest visual c++
        . Be carefult about the opengl dependencies that vcpkg will complain about in the output .
        . Note that even if we don't have access to xserver we can still build the 
            binary successfuly. We simply can't run it and see a GUI.
        . In this course, we will run it on windows
